I'm currently a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Southern Denmark where I study plant demography, teach data analysis to Master's students, and contribute to R packages that help others do interesting analyses.

# R package contributions

* [Rcompadre](https://jonesor.github.io/Rcompadre/) - access to the COM(P)ADRE demographic databases
* [Rage](https://github.com/jonesor/Rage) - tools for demographic analysis
* [rBBS](https://github.com/patrickbarks/rBBS) - access to the North American Breeding Bird Survey
* [cantempr](https://github.com/patrickbarks/cantempr) - access to Canadian homogenized temperature data

# Web apps
* [Canada-Clim](https://patrickbarks.github.io/canada-clim/) - a D3.js app to examine Canadian climate trends
* [Shiny-Bayes](https://patrickbarks.shinyapps.io/bayes/) - a Shiny app to illustrate Bayesian inference
